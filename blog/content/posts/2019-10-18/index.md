## What is our inspiriation?
Climate change is finally being brought to the attention of the world at large. If just a few school children can grab world headlines for missing school on Fridays, then surely the blockchain community can strive to solve climate change problems.

How do we create a efficient carbon credit environment where entities worldwide can fairly and transparently become and showcase they are carbon neutral entities.

## Some context: 
> A carbon credit is a generic term for any tradable certificate or permit representing the right to emit one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas. 

> Unchecked, energy use and hence emission levels are predicted to keep rising over time. Thus the number of companies needing to buy credits will increase, and the rules of supply and demand will push up the market price, encouraging more groups to undertake environmentally friendly activities that create carbon credits to sell.

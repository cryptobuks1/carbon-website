## How does it work?
1) Spekboom plantations in the Karoo of South Africa provide one of the most cost effective carbon offset solutions. 
2) We represent these plantations individually as always for sale NFTs. 
3) Holding an NFT continuously generates verifiable carbon credits (ERC20 tokens). 
4) Corporations can burn carbon credits to transparently showcase they are carbon neutral.
5) The Harberger tax received from the entities holding the always for sale NFTs, flows directly to the farmers for income and the upkeep of the spekboom plantations.
